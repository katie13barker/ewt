        Hi boys. I'm Tina. Drop the towel. There's someone behind the milk. Maybe it's the
        dairy fairy. And I'm gonna read it to the whole school myself. Put it on a t-shirt,
        Jimmy Jr, I don't want to hear it. I've been using the toilet like an idiot. I'll
        wave at you every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I think I'm being attacked by zombies and I start screaming, 'Do you wanna make
        out?' And I make out with it. My bra's chafing me. Ok then, see you on our date!
        Not if you're a fish. Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the
        frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. Your body. You won't
        regret it, dad. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. under the disco ball, it'll be like we're
        all kissing Jimmy Jr under the disco ball. And I'm gonna read it to the whole school
        myself.

        Explore the morgue? I'm compiling a list of people I can mate with to repopulate the
        Earth. C'mon Dad, just let me bite down on the bean. I'm not spooked. What's the
        next thing after spooked? I'm that. I'm a smart, strong, sensual woman. Everything I
        know to be true just went out the window.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is where I thrash. Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous
        man would lend me his jacket, or his pants. Dad, if you believe you're beautiful,
        you will be. I did. Sometimes with Jimmy Jr, I don't know what to say. But now I
        don't know what not to say and it's like okay guys, who can get to my mouth first?
        Dad, if you believe you're beautiful, you will be. I did. I know how the shark thinks.
        It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just wants to go home.
